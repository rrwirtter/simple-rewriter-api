# ✅ YOUR API IS READY TO DEPLOY!

## 🎉 What I Fixed

I've fixed the API structure so it works perfectly with Vercel:

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Moved `rewrite.js` → `api/rewrite.js`
2. ✅ Moved `health.js` → `api/health.js`
3. ✅ Updated `vercel.json` configuration
4. ✅ Created deployment helper scripts

### Correct Structure:
```
api-deployment/
├── api/
│   ├── rewrite.js  ← Main API endpoint
│   └── health.js   ← Health check endpoint
├── package.json
├── vercel.json
├── test-api.html
└── ... (documentation files)
```
